		<p>Da gus is a white duck that lays golden eggs in the story <u>Giant guy and the tweensy grapevine</u>, I'm quite sure I got that right. Anyawy, back in the olden days, da gus was big and shrinked because big gus was very hungry and died from that, little gus on the other hand survived because it needed less <strike>gus meat</strike> vegetation and NOT meat. People was also scared of the big gus and killed them for meat, safety, and feather pillows. So the little gus survived and passed down its special trait just like how Darwin wanted it to. You might have gotten confused why the title said <strike>MY NAME IS JOHN CENA</strike> Charles! Stop it! You already hacked my mother's website, my friend at a school, and many of my messages to my friends!</p>

		<p>I actually don't know what the !DOCTYPE html tag exactly does, but it did remove some of the fancy line splitting thing that you can see under the title (If it does show). It basically seem to make the code <u>border-bottom:solid 2px;</u> go wrong <strike>I'm dum and copied and pasted from proffesional website like duh</strike> I didn't say that, although I DID copied and pasted some code from other websites, butt MANY websites DID use it so that's normal</p>

		<p class="left">When I got bored of Khan Academy, I started to just make temperoral (I don't spell well.) websites by editing the about:blank website, I don't actually remember how I discover it but I just did. Anyway, the developer tools on Microsoft Edge didn't had any of those fancy auto-fill things so I had to type some tags and " twice more often as usual. It wasn't that easy to transition, but I got the hang of it and made a lot of cool websites, all just to make jokes about my mom (They weren't all saved, how sad, but I did learn how to let some things go), two or one of them are saved in my Khan Academy account so it's not all doom and gloom. Also, I started using the | character because it's so cool for the title, and I also started using it for my personel documents 'cause they're also useful there. I just thought of a meme... Wait here, I'm going to make one in Kawping and post it here... Okay done:</p>

		<p class="left">Okay, anyway. I soon needed to learn how to code more because I found out how dumb I was so I went back to Khan Academy, and other than forgeting some tags and functions (In JS and prossesing.js), I also forgotten about the auto fill. Now, getting used to the autofill is actually harder for an unclear reason, I'm actually still typing the quotation marks twice. My one guess is that I might have been typing in Microsoft's devepoler tools longer than I have been in these fancy text editors</p>
