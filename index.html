		<p>Da gus is a white duck that lays golden eggs in the story <u>Giant guy and the tweensy grapevine</u>, I'm quite sure I got that right. Anyawy, back in the olden days, da gus was big and shrinked because big gus was very hungry and died from that, little gus on the other hand survived because it needed less <strike>gus meat</strike> vegetation and NOT meat. People was also scared of the big gus and killed them for meat, safety, and feather pillows. So the little gus survived and passed down its special trait just like how Darwin wanted it to. You might have gotten confused why the title said <strike>MY NAME IS JOHN CENA</strike> Charles! Stop it! You already hacked my mother's website, my friend at a school, and many of my messages to my friends!</p>
